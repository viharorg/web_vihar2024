Many animals use vocal signals for a range of ecologically-motivated purposes: from detecting predators/prey and marking territory, to expressing emotions or physiological state, establishing social relations and sharing information. Whether it’s a bird raising an alarm, a whale calling to potential partners, a dog responding to human commands, a parent reading a story with a child, or a business person accessing stock prices using Siri on an iPhone, vocalization provides a valuable communication channel through which behavior may be coordinated, social interactions are mediated, and information is acquired and distributed. Indeed, the ubiquity of vocal interaction has led to research across a diverse array of fields, from assessing animal welfare, to understanding the precursors of human language, to developing voice-based human-machine interaction. Clearly, there is potential for cross-fertilisation between disciplines; for example, using robots to investigate contemporary theories of language grounding, using machine learning to decode animal communication or adding vocal expressivity to the next generation of autonomous social agents. However, many opportunities remain unexplored, not least due to the lack of a suitable forum.

We invite original submissions of 5-page papers (with the 5th page reserved exclusively for acknowledgements and references) or 2-page extended abstracts in all areas of vocal interactivity. Accepted papers will be compiled in the VIHAR-2024 proceedings that will be published online. All papers should follow the [Interspeech 2024](https://interspeech2024.org/author-resources/) template. 

Suggested workshop topics may include, but are not limited to the following areas:
  - Self-supervised learning for vocal signals
  - Generative audio systems for vocal interactivity
  - Function of animal vocalizations:  discovery of information embedded within signals, testing for functional reference, linking vocal signals to behavior
  - Physiological and morphological comparisons between vocal systems in animals
  - Vocal imitation and social learning of vocal signals
  - Valence and emotion in vocal signals
  - Inter and intraspecies comparative analyses of vocalizations
  - Interspecific vocal interactivity between non-conspecifics.

The submission form should contain the following information:
 - Title
 - Authors (and institutional affiliations)
 - Abstract (max 1000 characters)
 - One sentence stating the relevance to VIHAR
 - Does this work relate to: Humans? Animals? Robots? (Multiple selections are certainly permitted!)
 - The paper or extended abstract should be submitted in PDF format (with fonts included)



<!--Almost all animals exploit vocal signals for a range of ecologically-motivated purposes: from detecting predators/prey and marking territory, to expressing emotions, establishing social relations and sharing information. Whether it’s a bird raising an alarm, a whale calling to potential partners, a dog responding to human commands, a parent reading a story with a child, or a businessperson accessing stock prices using Siri on an iPhone, vocalisation provides a valuable communications channel through which behaviour may be coordinated and controlled, and information may be distributed and acquired. Indeed, the ubiquity of vocal interaction has led to research across a diverse array of fields, from assessing animal welfare, to understanding the precursors of human language, to developing voice-based human-machine interaction. Clearly, there is potential for cross-fertilisation between disciplines; for example, using robots to investigate contemporary theories of language grounding, using machine learning to analyse different habitats or adding vocal expressivity to the next generation of autonomous social agents. However, many opportunities remain unexplored, not least due to the lack of a suitable forum.

**VIHAR-2021** is the third international workshop on **Vocal Interactivity in-and-between Humans, Animals and Robots**. Taking place virtyally in Paris, Frabce on 14-15 October 2021, VIHAR-2021 aims to bring together researchers studying vocalisation and speech-based interaction in-and-between humans, animals and robots from a variety of different fields. VIHAR-2021 will provide an opportunity to share and discuss theoretical insights, best practices, tools and methodologies, and to identify common principles underpinning vocal behaviour in a multi-disciplinary environment.

 We are aiming to keep the registration fee as low as possible.

The workshop follows the success of the International workshop on Vocal Interactivity in-and-between Humans, Animals and Robots ([VIHAR-2017](http://vihar-2017.vihar.org/)).

We invite original submissions of abstracts in all areas of vocal interactivity. Suggested workshop topics may include, but are not limited to the following areas:
  - Physiological and morphological comparisons between vocal systems in animals
  - Properties and functions of animal signals
  - Evolution of vocal interactivity
  - Vocal imitation and learning
  - Conveyance of emotion
  - Comparative analyses of human and animal vocalisations
  - Use of vocalisation
  - Vocal interactivity between non-conspecifics
  - Spoken language systems
  - Technology-based research methods
  - Vocal interaction with robots

To present your work/ideas at VIHAR you will need to submit:
 - Title
 - Authors (and institutional affiliations)
 - Abstract (max 500 words; you are also encouraged to include one image/diagram)
 - One sentence stating the relevance to VIHAR
 - Does this work relate to: Humans? Animals? Robots? (Multiple selections are certainly permitted!)

The number of proposals from each presenter (“first author”) is limited to two. The number of proposals that a co-author can be involved in is limited to five.

A panel of experts will curate the submissions in order to ensure they belong to the scope of the workshop.

A compilation of the abstracts will be published online on the workshop website in the form of abstracts-only proceedings.

The authors will have the opportunity to submit papers to special issue organized in a journal after the VIHAR workshop.

<!--- Open access journal publisher PeerJ is pleased to announce **two PeerJ Awards at VIHAR 2019**, to be awarded by an expert judging panel to the best submission/presentation from a student or early-career researcher. Each award includes a voucher for a free PeerJ publication (normally $1095), and aims to support students and early career researchers and bring continued awareness to the benefits that open access and open communication have in furthering scientific progress.
