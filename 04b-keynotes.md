Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas is a Lecturer of Animal-Computer Interaction at the University of Glasgow.  She has studied and built novel systems for animals for over ten years speaking widely on equity, design, and methods and theory behind animals interacting with computer-enabled systems globally. Her initial contribution to the field started with methods and approaches for dogs to control screen systems in their home. Today, Ilyena focuses on creating an animal-to-animal internet, animal controlled systems, and musical and video systems for monkeys with user-centred values at the core.

#### Biography
I completed my PhD in Chimpanzee Communication at the University of St Andrews, UK. After a brief post-doc at St Andrews I joined the University of
York as a lecturer in 2007. Since establishing my own research group at the University of York I have continued to examine communication and social
cognition in chimpanzees, but I have also investigated communication in other primates, including humans and dogs.
